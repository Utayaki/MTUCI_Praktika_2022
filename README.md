Keyword in audio recognition via Wav2KWS SOTA model


Instruction:
1. Download main repo https://github.com/qute012/Wav2Keyword. Contrary to instructions there - you don't have to install fairseq locally
2. I used CUDA 10.2 for my project. Necessary PyTorch version is 1.7.0 Please install it via
pip3 install torch==1.7.0 torchvision==0.8.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu102/torch_stable.html
Other requirements are easy to install via pip. If you have problems with hydra-core: "pip install hydra"; if you have problems with fairseq: "pip install fairseq==0.10"
3.
